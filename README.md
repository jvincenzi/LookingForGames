# Looking For Games

The idea: Looking For Games is an app that allows players to select a game/sport and find others in their area looking to play. It also
allows players to host a game of their own by sending out a notification of where and when a game will be held.

Target audience: The target audience is anyone that needs an opponent or teammate to play a game or sport. As well as businesses that are
looking to expand their customer base. With a corporate account, businesses can boost their traffic by advertising game events and a space 
to play on our app.

What are all the things that can be done with the app?
Users will be able to find games they want to play, as well as host games to find other players. 
Each user will be able to rate other players after a game and be able to add them to their friends list. 
Events can be set to either public or private, for example a birthday party.
Event invitations can be sent to all or some of a users friend list when creating an event.
